          For the last several years, I've been working at McKinsey & Company, progressing from a Senior Business Analyst to an Associate. In my current role, I've been involved in several intriguing projects, including developing Metaverse opportunities for clients, conducting business reviews for a Blockchain-as-a-Service company, and analyzing potential investments in emerging technologies like electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL).

          Previously, as a Senior Business Analyst, I've had the opportunity to contribute to McKinsey Global Institute research, partner with local governments, and develop analytic tools for COVID-19 response in healthcare. I also have experience in assessing the cyber certification market for investment potential.

          In terms of leadership, I served as the Treasurer for the Century Menâ€™s Society and was a selected member of the Zachry Leadership Program. I also co-founded Ntwrk, a start-up during my university years.
          Recognized for my community service, I received the Ad Astra award and was a finalist in the Aggie Pitch. My technical skills include Python, C++, MySQL, R, JavaScript, PHP, CSS, HTML, MATLAB, Alteryx, and Microsoft Excel. I'm also conversational in Spanish.
          Outside of work, I have a keen interest in basketball, tennis, and international travel. I also enjoy listening to podcasts, exploring the world of wine, volunteering in my community, and keeping up with the latest trends in artificial intelligence and cybersecurity.
